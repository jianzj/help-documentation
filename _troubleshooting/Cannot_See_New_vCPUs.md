**Q.** After you enabled 2x CPU overcommit on my cluster, why aren't the new VCPUs listed in Horizon?

**A.** The `cpu_allocation_ratio` (overcommit) is internally factored in to the decisions made by the Nova scheduler. As a result, while the API (Horizon) only lists, for example, 283 vCPUs total, as shown in the figure below, you will find that you are able to concurrently schedule new instances that require significantly more, up to the expected total (in this example) of 566. This is handled by the CoreFilter filter in the scheduler.

**Please also note:** Enabling overcommit does not affect any currently running virtual machines.  It only affects new virtual machines you create after overcommit is enabled.

**Q. Why does my quota look so low?

**A.**  Under "Limit Summary" in Horizon, the top graph is actually the vCPU quota limits for the project you're currently looking at. In each cloud, when you're looking at the Limits graphs in Horizon, you're viewing Quota Limits for the Project you're currently under, not total CPUs across the cluster and across all projects. This should be more clearly noted in Horizon, but for now, it is what it is.

You can update quotas using the command line by following the examples at http://ibm-blue-box-help.github.io/help-documentation/openstack/userdocs/quotas/#compute-quotas
